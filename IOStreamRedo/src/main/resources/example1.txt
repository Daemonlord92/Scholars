You cannot rewrite history! Not one line! It is! It's the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York. I know who I am, I… AM… THE DOCTOR! So these are my replacements. A dandy and a clown. I just have one question… do you know how to fly this thing? There's always something to look at if you open your eyes! Not allowed? Not allowed? Me, I’m allowed everywhere. Jamie, remind me to give you a lesson in tying knots, sometime.
